To fix the issue, ensure that the parent element has a defined width (e.g., `width: 500px;`) or use a different approach to achieve the desired layout.  Always double-check unit consistency within the `calc()` function.  If using percentages, make sure that the parent element's dimensions are defined.  Avoid relying on `calc()` to handle calculations where the context's dimensions are dynamic or not well-defined.  Consider alternative approaches like using flexbox or grid layout which might handle dynamic sizing more robustly.
